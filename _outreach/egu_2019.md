From 07 - 12 of April I was at EGU conference in Vienna. The EGU is one of the largest conferences in Europe for Geophysics. According to the EGU 16,273 scientists from 113 countries participated, of which 53% were under the age of 35 years. 5.531 oral, 9.432 poster, and 1.287 PICO presentations were presented. At the conference I presented my past [work](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL078943) on the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and how it impacts the Baltic Sea.
