The contest is called Rostock's Eleven, representing the 11 scientific institutes located in Rostock. Each institute is represented by one participant and I am really proud that I had the chance to represent the Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research (IOW). My talk was about the Baltic Sea and how it is influenced by the so called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The AMO is part of the so called natural variability in the ocean. A phenomena that changes the sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic periodically every 60 - 90 years.

All presentations were judged by journalists from all over Germany. All participants received in-depth feedback and tips how to present their work for journalists. I really enjoyed my time and especially liked the talks of the others. There is so much exciting science besides climate research.
