Students were introduced into the analysis of climate variability from years to millennia as recorded from instrumental data, historical documents and proxy data such as tree ring data or sediment cores. In addition the students have been introduced to R. My main contribution was to set up an enviroment where students could learn to code without worrying to much about the installation. We used an interactive jupyter notebook, which the students could access via our network. To overcome safety concerns we set up an virtual machine that runs a single docker instance for each student. 

## Wavelet lecture

During the winterschool I also prepared a lecture introducing the students to wavelet analysis. For more see __Code Section__.
