Mein Vortrag zum in der Session Salinity Dynamics mit dem Titel: The impact of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on the salinity variability of the Baltic Sea

## Text in den Conference Proceedings: 

### Baltic Sea

The  salinity  of  the  Baltic  Sea  is  mainly  driven  by  freshwater input  and  by  saltwater  inflows  from  the  North  Sea.  The freshwater input into the Baltic Sea comes either as river runoff or  as  positive  net  precipitation  (precipitation  ‐  evaporation) over  the  sea  surface.  The  river  runoff  is  influenced  by precipitation  over  the  drainage  basin.  The  discharge  of  the Baltic Sea drainage basin is exposed to low‐frequency variations due  to  changes  in  precipitation  and  evaporation  (Meier  and Kauker,  2003b).  Hence,  the  mean  salinity  in  the  Baltic  Sea  is affected  by  dry  and  wet  periods  that  occur  due  to  low‐frequency changes in precipitation and evaporation patterns. Incontrast,  saltwater  inflows  are  characterized  by  exceptional periods of strong easterly winds and following westerly winds on time scales of about 40 days. This suggests that the Baltic Sea  and  its  ecosystem  are  strongly  influenced  by  external atmospheric forcing.

###  Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation

Schimanke and Meier (2016) analyzed the decadal to centennial variability of the Baltic Sea. A wavelet analysis of the mean salinity of the Baltic Sea showed significant power in the 60‐120 year periodicity band, which we link to the Atlantic multidecadal  oscillation  (AMO),  i.e.  variations  in  northward heat  transport  in  the  ocean.  The  Atlantic  multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is defined as a multidecadal climate variability (60‐90  years)  of  sea  surface  temperature  (SST)  in  the  North Atlantic  with  alternating  warm  and  cool  phases  (Knight  et  al., 2006)(see Figure 1). It has been shown that regional multidecadal variability in the European region can be linked to the  AMO,  e.g  extreme  precipitation  (Casanueva  et  al.,  2014) and European summer climate (Enfield et al., 2001). In addition, there are several studies that focus on the physical mechanism behind  warm  AMO+  phase  and  cold  AMO‐  affecting  Europe (Peings and Magnusdottir, 2014; Zampieri et al., 2017). Even though several regional climate conditions have been related to the AMO, the origin of the AMO remains still unclearand its unique periodicity needs to be proven (Ruprich‐Robert et al., 2017). Some studies even use the term Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), since this does not imply that the AMV is only created by internal climate processes (Wang et al., 2017).

### AMO in General Circulation Models

General circulation models have shown that the AMO signal is closely  related  to  the  Atlantic  Meridional  Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which appears to drive the AMO. This multi‐ decadal variability can emerge in the absence of any external forcing but is also likely to be influenced by external forcing(Sutton and Dong, 2012). Zhang and Wang (2013) analyzed 27 coupled general circulation models (GCMs) and found a large inter‐model spread in amplitudes and frequencies with respect to the AMO. The spatial structure of the AMO also varies from model to model. This leads to the conclusion that most  models  can  reproduce  an  AMO  like  variability,  but  we cannot yet expect them to reproduce comparable atmospheric patterns  in  every  detail.  Still  GCMs  are  necessary  since observations of the AMO are limited to a period of roughly 150 years. With a defined frequency in the range of 60‐90 years, the results  of  a  spectral  analysis  of  the  AMO  must  be  considered with caution. In our study we used the Rossby Centre Ocean model (RCO) to simulate  the  period  from  950  –  1800  (Schimanke  and  Meier, 2016).  RCO  is  a  primitive  equation  circulation  model  with  a horizontal  resolution  of  2  nm  and  83  vertical  layers.  With  a thickness of 3m per vertical layer this results in a maximum depth of ~ 250m. RCO is forced by the Rossby Centre Atmosphere Model (RCA3) with a horizontal resolution of 0.44° covering nearly the whole area of Europe.  RCA3 provides 10‐m wind, 2‐m air temperature 2‐m specific humidity, precipitation, total  cloudiness  and  sea  level  pressure  fields.  RCA3  itself  is driven by ECHO‐G at the lateral boundaries.

### AMO and its influence on the Baltic Sea

The goal of this study is to find a coherence of the mean salinity of the Baltic Sea and the mean sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic which we define as AMO. A wavelet coherence analysis revealed a significant coherence between the AMO and the mean salinity of the Baltic Sea for the periodicity of 60‐120 years. The phase relationship is also in good agreement with a lagged response of the mean salinity. Since  the  salinity  of  the  Baltic  Sea  is  mainly  driven  by  river runoff,  we  analyzed  the  coherence  between  AMO  and precipitation  over  the  Baltic  Sea  drainage  basin.  Again,  the wavelet  coherence  revealed  significant  coherence  between AMO and precipitation in the period of 60‐120 years with both signals in phase.This  relationship  is  also  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  correlation  ofthe AMO index and precipitation over the Baltic Sea indicates apositive  correlation.  AMO+  phases  appear  to  cause  wetter conditions  in  our  simulation,  followed  by  a  decrease  of  the mean salinity of the Baltic Sea.

The  spatial  response  to  different  AMO  phases  is  complex. Therefore,  we  analyzed  season  composites.  Our  study  reveals that in winter the state of the AMO can make up to 7% of the mean  yearly  precipitation.    In  addition,  Figure  1  shows  the tendency of an increased number of warm AMO+ phases during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) compared to more AMO‐ phases during the Little Ice Age (LIA). In our simulation, these phases can be linked to dry and wet conditions over the Baltic Sea. This allows us to compare the mean salinity of the Baltic Sea during the MCA and the LIA and its relation to the AMO.In the future we will analyze in detail how the AMO signal impacts the mean salinity of the Baltic Sea and discuss in detail the influence of wind and sea level pressure patterns over the Baltic Sea area.
