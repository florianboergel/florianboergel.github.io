Coastal seas are of great importance to society. A prominent example of such a coastal sea is the Baltic Sea, since it is strongly impacted by human activities. However, besides the human footprint there are also natural phenomena, that influence the Baltic Sea. Especially climate phenomena over the North Atlantic can have a strong impact on the Baltic Sea. One such phenomenon is the so‐called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a seesaw between warm and cold sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic with a period of 60‐90 years. Reliable observations only exist for a period of about 150 years, which is too short to study multidecadal time scales. Therefore, we use an 850 years long model simulation. Our results show that changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature associated with the AMO influence the atmospheric circulation, which impacts the rain and snowfall over the Baltic Sea region. This in turn enhances or decreases the river runoff into the Baltic Sea and thus impacts the Baltic Sea salinity. Thus, the AMO has a strong influence on the Baltic Sea.
