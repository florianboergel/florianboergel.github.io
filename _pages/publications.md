Coastal seas are of great importance to society. A prominent example of such a coastal sea is the Baltic Sea, since it is strongly impacted by human activities. However, besides the human footprint there are also natural phenomena, that influence the Baltic Sea. Especially climate phenomena over the North Atlantic can have a strong impact on the Baltic Sea. One such phenomenon is the so‐called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a seesaw between warm and cold sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic with a period of 60‐90 years. Reliable observations only exist for a period of about 150 years, which is too short to study multidecadal time scales. Therefore, we use an 850 years long model simulation. Our results show that changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature associated with the AMO influence the atmospheric circulation, which impacts the rain and snowfall over the Baltic Sea region. This in turn enhances or decreases the river runoff into the Baltic Sea and thus impacts the Baltic Sea salinity. Thus, the AMO has a strong influence on the Baltic Sea.

## Temperature variability of the Baltic Sea since 1850 and attribution to atmospheric forcing variables

The Baltic Sea is highly impacted by global warming and other anthropogenic changes and is one of the fastest‐warming marginal seas in the world. To detect trends in water temperature and to attribute them to atmospheric parameters, the results of two different ocean circulation models driven by reconstructed atmospheric forcing fields for the period 1850‐2008 were analysed. The model simulations were analysed at temporal and spatial scales from seasonal to centennial and from intra‐basin to basin, respectively. The strongest 150‐year trends were found in the annual mean bottom temperature of the Bornholm Deep (0.15 K/decade) and in summer mean sea surface temperature (SST) in Bothnian Bay (0.09‐0.12 K/decade). A comparison of the time periods 1856‐2005 and 1978‐2007 revealed that the SST trends strengthened 10‐fold. An attribution analysis showed that most of the SST variability could be explained by the surface air temperature (SAT), i.e., sensible heat flux, and the latent heat flux. Wind parallel to the coast and cloudiness additionally explained SST variability in the coastal zone affected by the variations in upwelling and in offshore areas affected by the variations in solar radiation, respectively. In contrast, the high variability in stratification caused by fresh‐ and saltwater inflows does not impact the long‐term variability in the SST averaged over the Baltic Sea. The strongest SST trends since the 1980s can be explained by the superposition of global warming and a shift from the cold to the warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).
