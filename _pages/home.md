### About me

I'm a tenured research scientist at the <a href="https://www.io-warnemuende.de/en_index.html">Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research</a> in Warnem√ºnde and member of the working group <a href="https://www.io-warnemuende.de/dynamics_regional_climate.html"> Dynamics of regional climate systems</a>. In my research I try to understand how longterm variability in the atmosphere and ocean affects Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea on timescales of 10 to 1,000 years.  For my research on the teleconnection between the North Atlantic Ocean and Northern Europe, I was recently awarded the <a href="https://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/division-outstanding-ecs-award/2023/florian-borgel/">2023 Division Outstanding Early Career Scientist Award</a> in the Ocean Sciences division at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly.

### Current research

My current research tries to disentangle natural climate variability in northern Europe. More specifically, I focus on the role of the North Atlantic Ocean in the climate system and its impact on Northern Europe. This undertaking necessitates a combination of global and regional climate simulations, which is an approach that has not received significant attention in the past but deserves thorough investigation.

Hence, in 2023 I established a working group as part of the Baltic Earth Network, which is affiliated with the Global Energy and Water Exchanges project and operates within the framework of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). The working group 'Teleconnection between the North Atlantic and Northern Europe' comprises 23 members from the Baltic Sea region. The primary objective of this group is to investigate the influence of the Atlantic Ocean on the Baltic Sea region (see <a href="https://baltic.earth/working_groups/teleconnections/">https://baltic.earth/working_groups/teleconnections/</a>)
