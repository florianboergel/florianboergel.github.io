## Teaching

I am a co-supervisor of the graduate course <a href="https://baltic.earth/news/106940/index.php.en">Climate of the Earth System</a> introducing students to fundamental processes of the climate system. For more information see our interactive <a href="https://florianboergel.github.io/climateoftheocean/intro.html">course site</a>.
