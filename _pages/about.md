Hey, my name is Florian and I am a PhD student at the Institute for Baltic Sea Research. During my PhD I will focus on the long-term variability in the Baltic Sea. This helps to understand changes of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. While I will likely focus on the Baltic Sea I hope that I can apply my findings to other coastal oceans, too. Semi-enclosed seas like the Baltic Sea respond very sensitive and fast to atmospheric changes e.g. global warming. This helps to predict changes to other coastal oceans.

## Interests

-    climate variability and climate sensitivity of the Baltic Sea
-   coupled physical-biogeochemical modeling to study the marine ecosystem in past climates
-    sea ice modeling
-    ice-ocean model inter-comparison
-    paleoclimate studies of the Baltic Sea
-    longterm trends in the Baltic Sea

## Methods

-    Data handling
-    Multi regression analysis for data prediction
-    Wavelet analysis
-    Network analysis
-    Cluster analysis
-    EOF
