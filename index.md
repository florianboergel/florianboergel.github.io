## About

Hey, my name is Florian and I am working as a Postdoc at the Leibniz-Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Warnemünde.

## Research interest

 In my research I try to understand how longterm variability in the atmosphere and ocean affects Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea on timescales of 10 to 1,000 years.

At our institute we use numerical models of the ocean to answer these questions. Therefore, I would call myself a computational oceanographer. While I will likely focus on the Baltic Sea I hope that I can apply my findings to other coastal oceans, too. Semi-enclosed seas like the Baltic Sea respond very sensitive and fast to atmospheric changes e.g. global warming.
