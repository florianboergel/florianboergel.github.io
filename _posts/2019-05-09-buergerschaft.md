On 26th of May we will not only vote the European Parliament but also for the local parliament in Rostock. And for some reason I ended up being a candidate.

I think similar to many others I was very worried after the last election back in 2016. Strong right oriented political parties became stronger and were dominating the news. Suddenly the public discussion shifted and the whole country was talking about whether we should decide to close our borders. We discussed whether it is OK to let people drown in the open sea.

I still remember how excited I felt when the Euro was introduced in Germany. On vacation we could simply drive to Italy without any border control. When traveling other countries in Europe I always felt at home. I expected that the European Union will become closer. Maybe even something like the United States of Europe.

Most of my friends and agreed with that feeling and we were hoping for
change. More and more we started complaining about everything that happened. On top of that in 2016 I moved to Rostock. Rostock is a great city, but totally different from my home town Münster. Sometimes I feel people don't know how great Rostock is and can be. A city with the sea nearby.

Therefore, I decided to help to change that and joined the political party 'Die Grünen'. Working with 'Die Grünen' have been really great. I learned a lot about the city and met awesome people. While I am at the very last spot during this election, I really enjoyed supporting our campaign. Hanging Posters, joining public discussion, handing over flowers in the city and forcing my colleagues to vote for me ;-)
