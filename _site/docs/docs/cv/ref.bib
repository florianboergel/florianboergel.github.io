  abstract = {We analyze multidecadal temperature fluctuations of the Atlantic Ocean and their influence on Northern Europe, focusing on the Baltic Sea, without a priori assuming a linear relationship of this teleconnection. Instead, we use the method of low-frequency component analysis to identify modes of multidecadal variability in the Baltic Sea temperature signal and relate this signal to the Atlantic climate variability. Disentangling the seasonal impact reveals that a large fraction of the variability in Baltic Sea winter temperatures is related to multidecadal temperature fluctuations in the North Atlantic, known as Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). The strong winter response can be linked to the interaction between the North Atlantic Oscillation and the AMV and is maintained by oceanic inertia. In contrast, the AMV does not influence the Baltic Sea’s summer and spring water temperatures.},

  abstract = {The Baltic Sea is among the fastest-warming seas globally in recent decades affecting biogeochemical conditions such as euxinic areas but also pelagic and benthic marine ecosystems. It is therefore crucial to understand how this heat gain is distributed vertically. We used reconstructed atmospheric forcing fields for 1850–2008 to perform an ocean climate simulation that adequately captures climatogical temperature and salinity profiles. Then, a water mass classification distinguishes three water masses corresponding to the classical view, warm and fresh surface waters, cold and fresh intermediate waters, and cold and salty bottom waters, and two transition water masses. The temperature trends show a similar three layers pattern with  fast~warming at the surface (\textasciitilde\,0.06~K decade−\,1) and bottom ({$>$}\,0.04~K decade−\,1) and slow in the intermediate layers ({$<$}\,0.04~K decade−\,1). The slow warming in the intermediate layer is explained by both weakly warmed water winter convection and the summer surface thermocline isolating the intermediate layers. The warming in the deep layers is related to warm surface inflow from the North Sea and Baltic proper in the southern and northern Baltic Sea respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments show that the warming magnitude is controlled by rising air temperature while the vertical distribution of heat gain is related to surface wind conditions. Finally, the North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation are well correlated with the temperature minimum and thus modulate the magnitude of warming in the intermediate layers on shorter time scales. This study provides a new picture of the Baltic Sea’s warming and suggests that this complexity is essential for understanding the influence of climate change on marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The Baltic Sea watershed includes the territories of 14 countries in Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe. Long-term observations have shown that the climate in this area is characterised by a pronounced multidecadal variability, with a period of about 30 years, but its origin is thus far unknown. We propose that the observed \textasciitilde 30-year fluctuations in Baltic Sea salinity are caused by the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and the North Atlantic Oscillation, which together modulate precipitation over the watershed and hence the river discharge into the Baltic Sea. The return of a large portion of the outflowing brackish Baltic Sea water with the inflowing salt water, due to mixing at the entrance area results in a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the multidecadal variations in salinity. The strength of this self-amplification is considerable since atmospheric forcing has nearly the same periodicity as the response time of the freshwater content to external freshwater inputs.},

	abstract = {European climate is heavily influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, the spatial structure of the NAO is varying with time, affecting its regional importance. By analyzing an 850-year global climate model simulation of the last millennium it is shown that the variations in the spatial structure of the NAO can be linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The AMO changes the zonal position of the NAO centers of action, moving them closer to Europe or North America. During AMO+ states, the Icelandic Low moves further towards North America while the Azores High moves further towards Europe and vice versa for AMO- states. The results of a regional downscaling for the East Atlantic/European domain show that AMO-induced changes in the spatial structure of the NAO reduce or enhance its influence on regional climate variables of the Baltic Sea such as sea surface temperature, ice extent, or river runoff.},

	abstract = {The North Atlantic exhibits temperature variations on multidecadal time scales, summarized as the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV). The AMV plays an essential role for regional climate and is a key driver of the low-frequency variability in Northern Europe. This study analyzed the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) control runs. The results showed that the physical mechanisms underlying decadal or longer time scales differ among CMIP6 models, which allowed them to be sorted into two clusters. For the first cluster, a significant coherence between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the AMV was found. Further, it showed a strong negative NAO response and decreasing precipitation over Northern Europe. In contrast, the second cluster showed no significant coherence between NAO and AMV. This non-coherent cluster developed a low-pressure anomaly in the subpolar gyre and showed increasing precipitation over Europe. Differences in the northward extension of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) between the two clusters were identified and linked to the different atmospheric responses. Our findings have important implications for European climate, since predictions of an increase or decrease in precipitation over Northern Europe will be model-dependent.},

	abstract = {The Baltic Sea is one of the fastest-warming semi-enclosed seas in the world over the last decades, yielding critical consequences on physical and biogeochemical conditions and on marine ecosystems. Although long-term trends in sea surface temperature (SST) have long been attributed to trends in air temperature, there are however, strong seasonal and sub-basin scale heterogeneities of similar magnitude than the average trend which are not fully explained. Here, using reconstructed atmospheric forcing fields for the period 1850–2008, oceanic climate simulations were performed and analyzed to identify areas of homogenous SST trends using spatial clustering. Our results show that the Baltic Sea can be divided into five different areas of homogeneous SST trends: the Bothnian Bay, the Bothnian Sea, the eastern and western Baltic proper, and the southwestern Baltic Sea. A classification tree and sensitivity experiments were carried out to analyze the main drivers behind the trends. While ice cover explains the seasonal north/south warming contrast, the changes in surface winds and air-sea temperature anomalies (along with changes in upwelling frequencies and heat fluxes) explain the SST trends differences between the sub-basins of the southern part of the Baltic Sea. To investigate future warming trends climate simulations were performed for the period 1976–2099 using two RCP scenarios. It was found that the seasonal north/south gradient of SST trends should be reduced in the future due to the vanishing of sea ice, while changes in the frequency of upwelling and heat fluxes explained the lower future east/west gradient of SST trend in fall. Finally, an ensemble of 48 climate change simulations has revealed that for a given RCP scenario the atmospheric forcing is the main source of uncertainty. Our results are useful to better understand the historical and future changes of SST in the Baltic Sea, but also in terms of marine ecosystem and public management, and could thus be used for planning sustainable coastal development.},

The Baltic Sea model inter-comparison project (BMIP), introduced herein, was therefore established as a platform for the scientific analysis and systematic comparison of Baltic Sea models. The inclusion of a physically consistent regional reanalysis data set for the period 1961\&ndash;2018 allows standardized meteorological forcing and river runoff. Protocols to harmonize model outputs and analyses are provided as well.\${\textless}\$/p\${\textgreater}\$ \${\textless}\$p\${\textgreater}\$An analysis of six simulations performed with four regional OGCMs differing in their resolution, grid coordinates, and numerical methods was carried out to explore inter-model differences despite harmonized forcing. Uncertainties in modeled surface temperatures were shown to be larger at extreme than at moderate temperatures. In addition, a roughly linear increase in the temperature spread with increasing water depth was determined and indicated larger uncertainties in the near-bottom layer. On the seasonal scale, the model spread was larger in summer than in winter, likely due to differences in the models\&rsquo; thermocline dynamics. In winter, stronger air-sea heat fluxes and vigorous convective and wind mixing reduced the inter-model spread. Uncertainties were likewise reduced near the coasts, where the impact of meteorological forcing was stronger. The uncertainties were highest in the Bothnian Sea and Bothnian Bay, attributable to the differences between the models in the seasonal cycles of sea ice triggered by the ice-albedo feedback. However, despite the large spreads in the mean climatologies, high inter-annual correlations between the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of all models and data derived from a satellite product were determined. The exceptions were the Bothnian Sea and Bothnian Bay, where the correlation dropped significantly, likely related to the effect of sea ice on air-sea heat exchange.\${\textless}\$/p\${\textgreater}\$ \${\textless}\$p\${\textgreater}\$Marine heat waves (MHWs), coastal upwelling, and stratification were also assessed. In all models, MHWs were more frequent in shallow areas and in regions with seasonal ice cover. An increase in the frequency (regionally varying between {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 50 and 250 \%) and duration (50\&ndash;150 \%) of MHWs during the last three decades in all models was found as well. The uncertainties were highest in the Bothnian Bay, likely due to the different trends in sea-ice presence. All but one of the analyzed models overestimated upwelling frequencies along the Swedish coast, the Gulf of Finland, and around Gotland while they underestimated upwelling in the Gulf of Riga. The onset and seasonal cycle of thermal stratification likewise differed among the models. Compared to observation-based estimates, in all models the thermocline in early spring was too deep whereas a good match was obtained in June, when the thermocline intensifies.\${\textless}\$/p\${\textgreater}\$},

	abstract = {The Baltic Sea is highly impacted by global warming and other anthropogenic changes and is one of the fastest-warming marginal seas in the world. To detect trends in water temperature and to attribute them to atmospheric parameters, the results of two different ocean circulation models driven by reconstructed atmospheric forcing fields for the period 1850–2008 were analyzed. The model simulations were analyzed at temporal and spatial scales from seasonal to centennial and from intrabasin to basin, respectively. The strongest 150-year trends were found in the annual mean bottom temperature of the Bornholm Deep (0.15 K/decade) and in summer mean sea surface temperature (SST) in Bothnian Bay (0.09–0.12 K/decade). A comparison of the time periods 1856–2005 and 1978–2007 revealed that the SST trends strengthened tenfold. An attribution analysis showed that most of the SST variability could be explained by the surface air temperature (i.e., sensible heat flux) and the latent heat flux. Wind parallel to the coast and cloudiness additionally explained SST variability in the coastal zone affected by the variations in upwelling and in offshore areas affected by the variations in solar radiation, respectively. In contrast, the high variability in stratification caused by freshwater and saltwater inflows does not impact the long-term variability in the SST averaged over the Baltic Sea. The strongest SST trends since the 1980s can be explained by the superposition of global warming and a shift from the cold to the warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.},

The study is an update of the {\textbackslash}emphSecond Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Based on the summaries of the recent knowledge gained in palaeo-, historical, and future regional climate research, we find that the main conclusions from earlier assessments still remain valid. However, new long-term, homogenous observational records, for example, for Scandinavian glacier inventories, sea-level-driven saltwater inflows, so-called Major Baltic Inflows, and phytoplankton species distribution, and new scenario simulations with improved models, for example, for glaciers, lake ice, and marine food web, have become available. In many cases, uncertainties can now be better estimated than before because more models were included in the ensembles, especially for the Baltic Sea. With the help of coupled models, feedbacks between several components of the Earth system have been studied, and multiple driver studies were performed, e.g. projections of the food web that include fisheries, eutrophication, and climate change. New datasets and projections have led to a revised understanding of changes in some variables such as salinity. Furthermore, it has become evident that natural variability, in particular for the ocean on multidecadal timescales, is greater than previously estimated, challenging our ability to detect observed and projected changes in climate. In this context, the first palaeoclimate simulations regionalised for the Baltic Sea region are instructive. Hence, estimated uncertainties for the projections of many variables increased. In addition to the well-known influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation, it was found that also other low-frequency modes of internal variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, have profound effects on the climate of the Baltic Sea region. Challenges were also identified, such as the systematic discrepancy between future cloudiness trends in global and regional models and the difficulty of confidently attributing large observed changes in marine ecosystems to climate change. Finally, we compare our results with other coastal sea assessments, such as the North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment (NOSCCA), and find that the effects of climate change on the Baltic Sea differ from those on the North Sea, since Baltic Sea oceanography and ecosystems are very different from other coastal seas such as the North Sea. While the North Sea dynamics are dominated by tides, the Baltic Sea is characterised by brackish water, a perennial vertical stratification in the southern subbasins, and a seasonal sea ice cover in the northern subbasins.\${\textless}\$/p\${\textgreater}\$},

Specifically, dynamical downscaling using a regionally coupled atmosphere–ocean climate model was used to regionalise four global Earth system models. However, as the regional climate model does not include components representing terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry, an additional catchment and a coupled physical–biogeochemical model for the Baltic Sea were included. The scenario simulations take the impact of various global sea level rise scenarios into account. According to the projections, compared to the present climate, higher water temperatures, a shallower mixed layer with a sharper thermocline during summer, less sea-ice cover and greater mixing in the northern Baltic Sea during winter can be expected. Both the frequency and the duration of marine heat waves will increase significantly, in particular in the coastal zone of the southern Baltic Sea (except in regions with frequent upwellings). Nonetheless, due to the uncertainties in the projections regarding regional winds, the water cycle and the global sea level rise, robust and statistically significant salinity changes could not be identified. The impact of a changing climate on biogeochemical cycling is predicted to be considerable but still smaller than that of plausible nutrient input changes. Implementing the proposed Baltic Sea Action Plan, a nutrient input abatement plan for the entire catchment area, would result in a significantly improved ecological status of the Baltic Sea, including reductions in the size of the hypoxic area also in a future climate, which in turn would increase the resilience of the Baltic Sea against anticipated climate change. While our findings regarding changes in heat-cycle variables mainly confirm earlier scenario simulations, they differ substantially from earlier projections of salinity and biogeochemical cycles, due to differences in experimental setups and in input scenarios for bioavailable nutrients.\${\textless}\$/p\${\textgreater}\$},
